        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Book Lovers Haven was born out of a simple idea — to bring passionate readers together.
            What started as a small local book club quickly grew into a thriving online community of bookworms
            from around the world. Whether you're into fiction, nonfiction, poetry, or graphic novels,
            we have a corner just for you.
        </p>

        <p>
            We believe books are more than just paper and ink — they’re portals to new worlds, ideas, and emotions.
            Our mission is to make reading accessible, social, and endlessly enjoyable.
